History:

* Around 2010, the DVX-2100 series (6x2). Supported UDM twisted pair video I/O.
  These had 4 DVI-I and 2 UDM inputs, 1 DVI + UDM output, and 1 VGA or DVI.
  All support scaling, audio mixing, et c.
  Nice coloured buttons on the front panel for input selection.

* 2012, the DVX-2110 (4x2), DVX-2150/2155 (6x3) and DVX-3150/3155 (10x4).
  DVI inputs now also support HDMI. UDM replaced by DXLINK (HDBaseT ish).
  Loses the nice coloured input selection buttons.
  Adds WebConsole - Web Browser based configuration based on Flash and JSON

* 2015, DVX-2210 (4x2) DVX-2250/2255 (6x3), DVX-3250/3255.
  USB ports. Second network port. Improved network security

* Early 2020. DVX-2265-4K (6x2), DVX-3266-4K (8x4). Smaller (2 rack unit).
  No DVI ins. Dante audio I/O. 4K 4:4:4 video. HTML5 web broser configuration.


I settled on a DVX-2155HD-SP. It was the cheapest device (under $200AUS)
that I could experiemnt with on my own (i.e. supported Web Browser config).

What I have gleaned in 3 months research...




The good:

* Device has inbuilt test patterns and audio test tones

* DXLINK interfaces seem to have good compatibity with HDbaseT

* Video inputs can be named. On-screen display

* Ability to display logo in place of black/blue on inactive inputs

* The manuals document a lot of commands, wiring, et c.

* AMX has a forum with a lot of stuff. Mainly Netlinx programming.

* AMX lets private individuals join the forum.
  You don't need to work for an AV install company



The bad:

* Even though you can telnet in and run the documented switcher commands,
  the telnet interface doesn't give you any output from them.

* Some of the documented commands don't work.
  Luckily, I found amx-dvx-library on GitHub.
  Look for INVALID or Redacted in amx-dvx-library/amx-dvx-api.axi 

* VIDOUT_TESTPAT- doesn't seem to work,
  even though it is listed as good in that library?

* The CI command (Change Input?) fails -
  from a NetLinx program only! - if a video input is inactive.
  Doing a seperate VI (Video Input) and AI (Audio Input) command works,
  and in my case displays the OSD/logo to confirm the switch occurred.
  The real weirdness here is that from Telnet it works!
  Interestingly, the WebConfig screen does let you

* The OSD does not seem to work on output 3 (the DXLINK/HDbaseT one).

* Android/Apple phones, iPads and tablets don't support Flash.
  Most browsers are also droppng support,
  which means the inbuild Web server is almost useless.
  There is third-party software that supports iPhones,
  but it seems to require AMX touchscreens to be configured in your system,
  which is expensive



The ugly:

* I got an account on the forum, asked a few questions,
  after a few weeks even answered an old unanswered question.
  Two days later, my account is disabled and all my posts deleted.
  No idea why, because no emails or messages.
